I - Introduction
----------------

This is the implementation of NOA-OLSR, an extension of OLSR which
has an autoconfiguration algorithm that was developped at Niigata
University. It is based on OOLSR.
OOLSR is the INRIA re-implementation of the OLSR protocol in C++
(hence 'OO'LSR as in 'Object Oriented')

II - License
------------

This code and files in this package are property of Niigata University
and of project Hipercom.
It is distributed under the GPL license, version 2 or later:
see the file GPL-2.
SPECIAL EXCEPTION: as a special exception, permission is granted to use
the plugin (oolsr-plugin.so) with the NS-2 simulator: in that case
the OOLSR files are still distributed under the GPL-2, but distributing
the ns-2 simulator (w/ patches) along with OOLSR doesn't require you
do distribute NS-2 under GPL.

III - Compilation
-----------------

In short:
  cd src && make

Or better you may want to copy 'Makefile.private.template' to 
'Makefile.private' and edit it a little first:
  cd src && cp Makefile.private.template Makefile.private \
   && emacs Makefile.private && make

 By default the daemon is IPv4 only. Also IPv6 is supported only on Linux.

The normal result of the compilation is:
  oolsrd (stripped version of daemon_core): the daemon itself
  oolsr_simul: a 'simulation' based on a topology
plus intermediary libraries and plugins not used here.

  III.1 - Troubleshooting
  .......................

This was successfully compiled on Debian unstable (i.e. Debian Sid),
with a compiler g++ 3.3 and g++ 2.95.
Most problems come from not having <linux/netlink.h> installed
(it is in 'linux-kernel-headers' package on Debian Sid), from not having
a <linux/wireless.h> (same package), or from having a older glibc with missing
network functions (it is glibc 2.3.2 on Debian Sid).

IV - Running
------------

  IV.1 - Running the daemon
  .........................

  Then just run:
    ./oolsrd -i <first iface> -i <second iface> ... <options>

  (with the cygwin version, you should probably first look at all the 
   interfaces:
   ./oolsrd -i show
   and then use the indicated interface number to run OOLSR:
   ./oolsrd -i )


  IV.1.1 - Setting address selection and address mask
  ...................................................

  This part is new in NOA-OLSR:
First you can specify the address selection algorithm:
  --auto-conf-algorithm <algorithm identifier>
    with:
    . <algorithm identifier> = 0 :
      increment the address once, until it is not conflicting according
      to the busy list ; then increment it once again with a probability 
      of 0.5 per default (set with --auto-conf-increment-probability <p>)
    . <algorithm identifier> = 2 :
      choose random bits in the address

Then you can either set the prefix:
  --auto-conf-ipv4-prefix <ipv4 network>/<prefix length>
  (example: --auto-conf-ipv4-prefix 172.25.202.0/24)
  --auto-conf-ipv6-prefix <ipv6 network>/<prefix length>
  (example: --auto-conf-ipv4-prefix fd51:f2d1:91ad::0/112)
Or you can set the initial address:
  --auto-conf-ipv4-initial-address <ipv4 address>/<prefix length>
  (example: --auto-conf-ipv4-initial-address 172.25.202.202/24)
  --auto-conf-ipv6-initial-address <ipv6 address>/<prefix length>  
  (example: --auto-conf-ipv6-initial-address fd51:f2d1:91ad::1234/112)

In IPv4 you should use
  --auto-conf-hash-hello 1
  to use a OLSR broadcast address which is not a multicast address

You can set some parameters
  --kept-address <address>/<prefix length>
    by default NOA-OLSR removes all the addresses of the interface it
    is running on. This indicates that the given address should not
    removed (if it is found assigned to the interface)
  --auto-conf-no-state <boolean>
    if true, the protocol uses no states. Otherwise the state durations
    can by set by:
    --auto-conf-hello-state-duration <duration>
    and
    --auto-conf-topology-state-duration <duration>

Because NOA-OLSR is using iproute and iptables internally,
the path of these tools should be set if it is used:
  --ip-route-path <path>
     (default: /sbin/ip)
  --iptables-path <path>
     (default: /sbin/iptables)

  Other various protocol parameters can be set:
  max-tc-diff-seq-num (MAX_TC_DIFF_SEQ_NUM in draft),
  max-message-rate (MAX_MESSAGE_RATE in draft),
  etc... (NODE_STATE_HOLD_TIME, CONFLICT_HOLD_TIME, NODE_FAMILIAR_TIME,
  MAX_MPR_REMEMBER_TIME, MIN_TC_FAMILIARITY_RATE)

see documentation in src/parameters.def and the draft in draft/Draft/
  


  IV.2 - Running the daemon (IPv4)
  ................................

  As <options> you would pass:
     --use-ipv4
By default OLSR messages are sent on multicast address 224.0.0.1,
(for consistency with IPv6, which uses multicast as well),
you can change this with:
   --ipv4-multicast-address 255.255.255.255
for instance.
  

  IV.3 - Running the daemon (IPv6)
  ................................

  As <options> you would pass:
     --use-ipv6 1
(note: this will be changed to --use-ipv6 alone in further versions)
By default OLSR messages are sent on multicast address ff02::1,
you can change this with:
   --ipv6-multicast-address ff0e::1
for instance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The documentation that follows was for the original OOLSR - it is no
  longer valid for NOA-OLSR
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    IV.3.1 - IPv6, site-local addresses (or unique local addresses)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  You can configure IPv6 site-local addresses first on OLSR interfaces,
since OOLSR uses them - the idea being to take the link-local address
and replace the link-local prefix by a site-local prefix (i.e. fec0:...)

(note: you can also use unique local IPv6 addresses, locally assigned,
<http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ipv6-unique-local-addr-04.txt>,
i.e. fd00::/8 )
  
(Unix hint for setting site-local addresses:
  IFACE=eth0
  ADDR=$(ip addr show ${IFACE} | grep inet6 | cut -d/ -f1 | cut '-d6' -f 2)
  ip addr add $(echo ${ADDR} | sed s/fe80:/fec0:/)/64 dev ${IFACE}
)

    IV.3.2 - IPv6, any address
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    You can use the option --ipv6-address-filter <address or network>
to specify the address that should be used on an interface, for instance:
  --ipv6-address-filter fe80::0/64 
for link local addresses (which is a BAD idea for many reasons, including
the fact that they should not be routed).


  IV.4 - Running the 'simulation'
  ...............................

  You can run a 'simulation' (no physical/MAC layer simulated, no data
packets) with simul_static_plugee as:
    ./oolsr_simul --topology sample.topology
  or with something like:
    ./oolsr_simul 100 1 0.3 0.3 0.0
  This feature is not yet documented.

  Another way to use this feature is to go in the tools/ subdirectory
and look the Makefile, and read the tools/scenario/README file.

  IV.5 - Running the 'checks'
  ...........................

  You can run a simulations with a manually defined topologies. The format
is described in tools/scenario/README, some examples are in tools/scenario.
A way to run them is to go into directory tools/ and type "make".

V - Plugin
----------
  
  OOLSR can compile to a plugin (.so), used by the API presented in 
include/protocol-plugin-api.h . This plugin has been used in NS2.
More on this in some future version. See also VII NS2.


VI - Installation
-----------------

The installation is manual, since it is sufficient to copy oolsrd
in the proper place and add it to the start/stop scripts.

VII - NS 2
----------

You can use OOLSR as a plugin for NS-2.
In that case, it is easier to take the ns-allinone distribution with
integrated OOLSR.
  In that case, compilation is achieved, after extracting the .tar.gz
with the command: ./install in ns-allinone-2.27-oolsr-<version> directory.
You can then run the OOLSR as an agent, using the test such as:
  cd ns-allinone-2.27-oolsr-<version>
  cd ns-2.27/oolsr
  ../ns test-unicast.tcl
You can then examine logs in directory test-unicast-result, and for
information about using OOLSR in NS-2, just read the source
'test-unicast.tcl'. OOLSR is just a standard agent such as those used
in wireless ad hoc networks (see NS-2 documentation).
